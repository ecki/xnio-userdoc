== About XNIO
XNIO is a low-level I/O framework which provides an NIO-like channel-based abstraction with the introduction of callbacks, thread management, and advanced resource management capabilities. This framework provides simplified access to much of the lowest levels of network and file I/O available through Java, making it easier to implement ultra-high-performance network clients and servers with superior scalability.

This is not a framework for beginners. It is an advanced I/O mechanism designed for developers who are already intimately familiar with TCP/IP and operating system-level file and socket I/O mechanisms. This audience will find that XNIO provides access to many powerful constructs which are very difficult to access or utilize effectively with raw NIO.

This framework also provides many useful utility capabilities around buffer and thread management, asynchronous task handling and execution, streams, combining blocking and non-blocking I/O, and more.

=== XNIO Providers
XNIO's core functionality is implemented by XNIO _providers_. The default NIO provider runs on all platforms which support Java. However it is also possible to implement native providers which give access to lower-level features; such providers are planned for future XNIO releases.

To use the default NIO provider, simply ensure that its corresponding JAR is visible from the XNIO core API JAR.
